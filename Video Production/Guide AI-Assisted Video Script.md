# Guide: AI-Assisted Video Script Production for Journalism

> **Purpose:** This guide provides a complete, defensible workflow for creating high-quality, ethically sound scripts for AI-generated video. Users will learn to move from an initial idea to a fully certified, production-ready script while navigating the complexities of modern journalism, including security risks and disinformation threats.

## Overview

This guide establishes a systematic, security-conscious framework for producing AI-generated video scripts, specifically designed to meet the rigorous standards of modern journalism. In an era where AI can be a powerful tool for storytelling and a vector for sophisticated disinformation, a disciplined process is essential. This workflow is built to ensure that the final script is not only creative and compelling but also factually airtight, ethically sound, and technically feasible for production with today's leading AI tools.

You will accomplish the creation of a "Certified Script"—a document that has passed through multiple layers of verification and is ready for the AI generation phase. This process emphasizes front-loading the critical work of research, risk assessment, and structural planning to ensure a smooth and efficient production cycle. Before starting, you should have a clear project goal, an understanding of your target audience, and access to the necessary software.

> **Key Terms**
>
> *   **A/V (Audio/Visual) Script:** A two-column script format where one column details visual elements (shots, graphics, AI prompts) and the other contains all audio (narration, dialogue, sound effects).
> *   **Red Line Assessment:** A formal analysis of content to identify and mitigate risks related to crossing political, cultural, or religious taboos that could result in censorship or reprisal.
> *   **Verified Fact Sheet:** A master document serving as the single source of truth for a project, where every factual claim is logged with its sources, verification method, confidence level, and risk rating.
> *   **"VPN-Worthy" Content:** A strategic goal for content created for audiences in restrictive media environments; it must offer unique value (credibility, depth, engagement) compelling enough to make a user employ circumvention tools like a VPN to access it.

### Step 1: Develop the Project Strategy and Creative Brief

This foundational step translates an abstract idea into a concrete, actionable plan. A detailed Creative Brief aligns the entire team on the project's objectives, audience, and core message, preventing costly revisions later.

1.  **Draft the Creative Brief**
    
    Create a formal document that answers the fundamental strategic questions. This brief becomes the North Star for all subsequent decisions.
    
    → **Details:** Populate a template with the following sections:
    *   **Project Purpose:** What problem does this video solve?
    *   **Target Audience:** Who are we trying to reach? (Demographics, psychographics)
    *   **Core Message:** What is the single most important takeaway?
    *   **Success Metrics:** How will we measure success (e.g., views, engagement rate, website clicks)?
    *   **Tone & Format:** What is the desired tone (e.g., authoritative, investigative, empathetic)? What is the format and length (e.g., 90-second vertical explainer)?
    → **Tool:** Google Docs, Notion.

2.  **Define the Target Audience Persona**
    
    Move beyond simple demographics to build a deep understanding of your viewer's mindset.
    
    → **Details:** Use the "Empathy Map Exercise" framework to detail what your ideal viewer **Thinks, Feels, Sees, and Hears**. Identify their primary motivations and the "pain points" your video can address.

3.  **Establish the Message Architecture**
    
    Structure your communication for maximum clarity and impact.
    
    → **Details:** Define one clear **Primary Message**. Then, write 2-3 **Supporting Messages** that reinforce it. Under each supporting message, list the specific **Evidence** (data, quotes, facts from your research) you will use to prove it.
    → **Time:** 1-2 hours.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A one-page Creative Brief PDF is finalized.
**Verify:** The brief has been circulated and received digital sign-off from key stakeholders, such as the producer and senior editor.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   The Creative Brief is a living document at first but should be locked before scripting begins to prevent "scope creep."
> *   Avoid starting any creative work until the brief is fully approved by all decision-makers.

### Step 2: Conduct Secure and Verifiable Research

For journalism, the script is only as strong as the facts it's built on. This step establishes a rigorous and secure protocol for gathering and verifying all information before any creative writing begins.

1.  **Categorize and Verify All Factual Claims**
    
    Treat every piece of information with skepticism until it is independently confirmed.
    
    → **Details:** For every statistic, date, name, or factual assertion, apply the "Three-Source Verification Rule," confirming it with at least two other independent, credible sources. Log every claim in a spreadsheet.
    → **Tool:** Google Sheets, Airtable.

2.  **Implement Security Protocols (for sensitive topics)**
    
    In high-risk environments, journalistic ethics demand that you protect your sources as rigorously as you protect your facts.
    
    → **Details:** Conduct all communication with sources on end-to-end encrypted platforms like Signal. Store all research notes, transcripts, and source identities in a secure, encrypted container (e.g., a VeraCrypt volume) or a trusted, zero-knowledge cloud service.
    
    > ⚠️ **Warning:** An accurate fact obtained through insecure methods can directly lead to the arrest or harassment of a source. Security is a non-negotiable component of journalistic ethics in repressive environments.
    {: .prompt-warning }

3.  **Perform a "Red Line Assessment"**
    
    Proactively analyze your verified facts for potential political, cultural, or religious sensitivities.
    
    → **Details:** Review each fact against a list of known "red lines" or taboo topics. Assign a risk level (Low, Medium, High) to inform how the fact is framed or if it should be used at all.
    → **Time:** 4-8 hours.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A "Verified Fact Sheet" spreadsheet is complete and peer-reviewed.
**Verify:** Every claim in the sheet is linked to its corroborating sources, has a confidence level (High, Medium, Low), and includes a risk assessment rating.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Adopt a modified transparency policy for high-risk work. Be transparent with your audience about your verification *methods* (e.g., "confirmed with three officials in the ministry") without revealing source identities that could be compromised.
> *   Never trust a statistic in one news report without tracing it back to the primary source (e.g., the original academic study or government report).

### Step 3: Brainstorm and Select a Story Concept

With a bedrock of verified facts, you can now creatively explore the most effective ways to tell the story. The goal is to develop concepts that are both compelling and producible with AI tools.

1.  **Generate Diverse Story Angles**
    
    Go beyond the obvious narrative to find a unique, engaging approach.
    
    → **Details:** Use a structured brainstorming technique like the **SCAMPER** method (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to transform the core facts from your sheet into multiple distinct story ideas.
    → **Tool:** Miro, physical whiteboard, or a text document.

2.  **Create a Concept Shortlist**
    
    Develop your best ideas into concise, comparable formats for review.
    
    → **Details:** For your top 5-10 concepts, write a two-line summary. Define the key visual approach and the proposed AI tool (e.g., "AI Avatar presenter via HeyGen for a daily briefing," "Generative B-roll of historical Tehran via Runway"). Crucially, assign a political risk rating (Low/Medium/High) to each.
    → **Time:** 1-3 hours.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A document presenting 5-10 distinct video concepts is ready for editorial review.
**Verify:** Each concept has been cross-referenced with the Creative Brief to ensure it aligns with the target audience and core message.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   For every concept, ask the "VPN-Worthy" question: Does this story, told this way, offer unique credibility, analysis, or visual engagement that is unavailable from state-controlled media?
> *   Avoid developing concepts that are purely text-based. Always think about the visual potential and how AI can enhance it.

### Step 4: Architect the Narrative Structure

Before writing a single line of narration, you must design the narrative blueprint. This architectural step ensures the story has a logical flow, strong pacing, and a structure that supports the overall message.

1.  **Select a Narrative Framework**
    
    Choose the foundational structure that best serves the story you want to tell.
    
    → **Details:** Common effective structures include:
    *   **Linear/Chronological:** Best for historical explainers or recapping events.
    *   **Problem-Solution:** Ideal for investigative or explanatory journalism.
    *   **Human-Interest:** Uses a personal story to illustrate a larger issue.

2.  **Create a Scene-by-Scene Breakdown**
    
    Map out the entire video in sequential order.
    
    → **Details:** In a list or table, create an entry for every scene. For each one, define the:
    *   **Core Narrative Point:** The key piece of information to be conveyed.
    *   **Proposed AI Visual Technique:** The specific AI tool or method planned.
    *   **Estimated Duration:** The approximate length of the scene in seconds.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A structural blueprint document is finalized.
**Verify:** The scene list has been read through to confirm a logical narrative progression, and the sum of the estimated durations matches the target video length.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   A "Problem-Solution" structure can be a powerful risk mitigation tool. It allows you to dedicate most of the video to objectively detailing a verifiable problem, then use expert quotes or citizen testimony in the "solution" section to voice more pointed criticism.
> *   Don't start writing the full script until this blueprint is approved.
{: .prompt-info }

---

### Step 5: Write the Production-Ready Script

In this step, you transform the architectural blueprint into a complete, detailed script that contains every word, sound, and visual instruction needed for production.

1.  **Draft in Two-Column A/V Format**
    
    Use the industry-standard format for clarity and professionalism.
    
    → **Details:** Set up your document in a two-column table.
    *   **Left Column (VIDEO):** Describe all visual information: scene settings, camera shots, on-screen text (chyrons), and graphics.
    *   **Right Column (AUDIO):** Write out the full text for the narrator, interview clips, and specify any music or sound effects (SFX).
    → **Tool:** Final Draft, Celtx, or a pre-formatted Google Docs/Word template.

2.  **Integrate AI Production Notes**
    
    This is the most critical part of scripting for AI. You must translate creative vision into precise, technical instructions for the generative models.
    
    → **Details:** In the VIDEO column, write a specific "AI Production Note" for every shot that will be generated. Use a structured prompt formula for consistency and quality.
    
    ```text
    Prompt Formula: Subject + Action + Scene + (Camera Movement + Lighting + Style)
    ```

3.  **Time the Script by Reading Aloud**
    
    A script's word count is a poor indicator of its actual runtime. A timed read-through is essential.
    
    → **Details:** With a stopwatch, read the entire AUDIO column aloud at the intended performance pace (a typical conversational pace is 130-150 words per minute). Adjust wording and cut sentences to ensure the script fits the target duration precisely.
    → **Time:** 6-12 hours.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A complete, two-column A/V script is drafted.
**Verify:** Every generative visual described in the VIDEO column has a corresponding AI Production Note, and the script's timed length is within 5% of the target duration.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Write for the spoken word, not for the page. Use contractions (it's, they're) and simple, direct language.
> *   Avoid redundant narration. If the visual clearly shows a building on fire, the narrator should provide context (e.g., "The fire started at midnight"), not state the obvious ("The building is on fire").

### Step 6: Analyze, Revise, and Enhance the Script

A first draft is never a final draft. This critical review stage subjects the script to a rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation to identify weaknesses, mitigate risks, and ensure technical feasibility before committing to production.

1.  **Conduct a Five-Pass Revision**
    
    Review the script five separate times, focusing on only one area per pass. This disciplined approach prevents errors from being overlooked.
    
    → **Details:**
    *   **Pass 1: Narrative & Structure:** Is the story clear? Is the pacing effective?
    *   **Pass 2: Factual Accuracy:** Is every claim in the script 100% traceable to the Verified Fact Sheet?
    *   **Pass 3: Language & Tone:** Is the voice consistent? Is the language culturally appropriate?
    *   **Pass 4: Technical & AI Feasibility:** Are the AI prompts clear and achievable with the selected tools?
    *   **Pass 5: Legal & Ethical Risks:** Does any part of the script cross a "red line" or create defamation risk?

2.  **Perform a Disinformation Vulnerability Check**
    
    Think like an adversary. Actively probe the script for weaknesses that could be exploited by those looking to discredit your work.
    
    → **Details:** Ask questions like: "How could a state actor twist this phrase out of context?" or "Could this AI-generated visual be easily and credibly mislabeled as a 'deepfake'?" Strengthen the script's framing and sourcing to preemptively inoculate it against such bad-faith attacks.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A formal Script Analysis Report is created.
**Verify:** The report lists the script's strengths, details all identified weaknesses, and provides a clear, actionable recommendation for each required revision.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Triage all feedback. Revisions addressing security, legal, or factual integrity risks are non-negotiable and must be implemented first.
> *   Avoid the common mistake of trying to check for everything (story, facts, grammar) in a single read-through. The multi-pass method is far more effective.

### Step 7: Certify the Final Script for Production

This is the final quality gate. The script is subjected to a zero-tolerance review to ensure it is flawless and formally approved, providing a crucial layer of accountability before production begins.

1.  **Execute a Final Proofread and Fact-Check**
    
    This is the last check for perfection.
    
    → **Details:** A senior editor performs a final, meticulous review for any remaining typos, grammatical errors, or inconsistencies. They triple-check all names, dates, and figures against the Verified Fact Sheet.

2.  **Finalize the AI Disclosure Method**
    
    Commit to a specific transparency plan.
    
    → **Details:** Based on the AI Ethics Protocol, make the final decision on how the use of AI will be communicated to the audience. Options include a persistent on-screen watermark (e.g., "AI-Generated Visual"), a clear statement in the video's introduction or conclusion, or a detailed explanation in the description text.

3.  **Lock the Script with Formal Certification**
    
    This formal act concludes the pre-production phase and authorizes the start of AI generation.
    
    → **Details:** Attach a cover sheet to the final, approved script. The senior editor, lead journalist, and technical producer must sign it (physically or digitally), confirming that the script has met the organization's highest standards of quality, accuracy, and ethical rigor.
    → **Time:** 1-2 hours.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A certified, production-ready PDF of the final script is locked and distributed to the production team.
**Verify:** The script file is marked as "FINAL - LOCKED FOR PRODUCTION," and the signed cover sheet is attached.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   This formal, documented certification process is more than internal bureaucracy; it's an external shield. It creates a clear evidentiary trail of your commitment to due diligence, which can be a powerful defense if your work is ever legally or politically challenged.
> *   Never send an uncertified or "draft" version of the script to the production team, as this can lead to costly errors based on outdated information.

## Examples

### Example: Explainer on Iran's Water Crisis

This example shows how the process applies to a real-world scenario.

**Context:** The goal is a 2-minute explainer video for an international, social-media-savvy audience. The core message is that mismanagement, not just drought, is a key driver of Iran's water crisis. The risk profile is "Medium" due to implicit criticism of government policy.

**Workflow in Action:**

*   **Step 2 (Research):** The Verified Fact Sheet includes an entry: "Fact: Lake Urmia, once the largest lake in the Middle East, has lost over 90% of its surface area since the 1970s. Source: UN Environment Programme report. Confidence: High. Risk: Medium."
*   **Step 4 (Architecture):** A "Problem-Solution" structure is chosen. Scenes 1-4 detail the problem (shrinking lakes, dust storms) using data. Scenes 5-6 present the solution (expert quotes on better water management).
*   **Step 5 (Scripting):** A scene requires a visual of the devastated lake. The AI Production Note is written to be evocative and specific.

```text
AI Note (Runway Gen-4): Wide aerial shot, slow dolly forward, over a vast, cracked, and dried-up lakebed under a harsh midday sun. In the distance, a single, rusted, abandoned boat sits on the cracked earth. Style: photorealistic, 4K, desolate atmosphere, slightly desaturated color palette.
```

**Result:** The resulting script is fact-based and visually planned. The prompt is designed to generate a powerful, symbolic image that tells the story emotionally without requiring risky on-the-ground filming. The structure places the most sensitive content (criticism) in the mouths of quoted experts, providing a layer of journalistic defense.

## Best Practices & Common Mistakes

**✅ Best Practices:**

*   **Security First:** Always prioritize the security of your sources and data. Use encryption as a default for all sensitive journalistic work.
*   **Create "VPN-Worthy" Content:** Focus on producing unique, high-value content that audiences cannot get from state-controlled media.
*   **Build Trust Through Transparency:** Be proactively and consistently clear with your audience about when, how, and why you are using AI tools. This is your best defense against disinformation.
*   **Codify Learnings:** Maintain an internal "AI Production Style Guide" that documents successful prompt formulas and risk-mitigation strategies to speed up future productions.

**❌ Avoid These:**

*   **Relying on AI Detection Tools:** Current deepfake detectors are unreliable and easily fooled. A strong journalistic process is a more robust defense than any detection software.
*   **Over-Explaining the Visuals:** Trust your images. Use narration to provide context and information the visuals cannot convey on their own.
*   **Neglecting the Vertical Format (9:16):** For mobile-first audiences, vertical video is the primary format, not an afterthought. Plan for it from the beginning.
*   **Changing Meaning in Edits:** Never edit an interview clip (a "frankenbite") in a way that changes the speaker's original meaning or intent. This is a severe ethical breach.
