# How to Write Professional News Headlines and Leads

> **Purpose:** This guide provides a structured methodology for novice journalists to craft formal, effective news headlines and lead paragraphs. You will learn to analyze a story's value, identify its core angle, and apply professional rules for maximum clarity and impact.

## Overview

In the digital news landscape, the headline and lead paragraph are the most critical elements of any article. They are the gateways that determine whether a reader will engage with your work. A powerful headline sparks curiosity and communicates value, while a concise lead delivers the most crucial information immediately. Mastering their creation is arguably the single most important technical skill for a developing journalist.

This guide moves beyond simple tips to provide a step-by-step process for writing openings that are clear, accurate, and compelling. We will deconstruct the foundational concept of the **Inverted Pyramid**—the structural backbone of news writing—and use it to inform every decision. By following this guide, you will learn to analyze a story like a seasoned editor, craft headlines that are brutally efficient, and write leads that summarize the most vital information in a single, authoritative sentence. The only prerequisite is a fully researched and understood news story.

> **Key Terms:**
> - **Inverted Pyramid:** The standard structure for news articles where the most important information is at the top (the lead), followed by supporting details in the middle, and the least essential information at the bottom.
> - **Lead (or Lede):** The opening paragraph of a news story, typically a single sentence, that summarizes the most critical facts (Who, What, When, Where).
> - **News Values:** A set of criteria (Impact, Timeliness, Proximity, Conflict, etc.) used by journalists to determine a story's newsworthiness.
> - **Attribution:** Citing the source of information, for example, "...officials said" or "...according to the report."

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Analyze the Story and Identify the Core Angle

Before you can write a summary, you must deeply understand the story's significance. This step is about analytical rigor, not writing.

1.  **Evaluate Against News Values**
    Systematically score your story's key facts against the primary news values: Impact (how many people are affected?), Timeliness, Proximity, Conflict, Prominence, Novelty (is it unusual?), and Human Interest.
    
    *   **Details:** The fact with the highest score, especially on Impact or Novelty, is almost always your core angle.
    *   **Expected:** You have a clear sense of *why* this story matters to your audience.

2.  **Map the 5Ws and H**
    In a document, create a simple list answering the 5Ws and H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) with concise, factual statements. This creates an inventory of all essential information.
    
    *   **Details:**
        *   Who? City Council.
        *   What? Approved a 15% property tax increase.
        *   When? Tuesday night.
        *   Where? City Hall.
        *   Why? To fund school repairs.
        *   How? By a 5-4 vote.
    *   **Expected:** A clear, scannable list of the story's key components.

3.  **Perform the "Urgent Sentence" Test**
    Verbally summarize the story for a colleague in a single, rushed sentence, as if you have only a moment to tell them the news.
    
    *   **Details:** Pay close attention to the very first fact you mention. This instinctive prioritization reveals the most compelling element for a general audience.
    *   **Expected:** You have a gut-check confirmation of your story's most important angle.

**✓ Checkpoint:** You have a single, written sentence that clearly states the most important, impactful, or surprising element of the story.
**Verify:** A colleague reads only this sentence and can accurately describe the story's main point.

> 💡 **Tips:**
> *   **Focus on the Consequence:** The most important element is often the *result* or *impact* of an action, not the action itself. "City faces $5M budget shortfall" is stronger than "City council discusses budget."
> *   **Common Mistake:** Mistaking the topic for the story. "A report on teen mental health" is a topic. "Teen anxiety rises 25%" is the story.

### Step 2: Craft a Formal News Headline

The headline is a brutally efficient summary, not a creative flourish. Its job is to inform, not to intrigue.

1.  **Write in Active Voice and Present Tense**
    Structure your headline as Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Use the simple present tense (the "historical present") for recent events to create a sense of immediacy.
    
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Passive (Weak):** *A new policy was announced by the government.*
        *   **Active (Strong):** *Government announces new policy.*
    *   **Expected:** A headline that is energetic and clear.

2.  **Enforce Strict Conciseness**
    Limit the headline to **5 to 10 words** (or a maximum of 8 words for some traditions like Persian-language journalism). To achieve this, eliminate articles ("a," "an," "the") and use numerals for all numbers (e.g., "5," not "five").
    
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Wordy:** *The city council has approved a new budget for the parks.*
        *   **Concise:** *City council approves new parks budget.*
    *   **Expected:** A tight, punchy headline with no wasted words.

3.  **Integrate Keywords**
    Naturally include the primary keywords (e.g., names of people, places, key topics) for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This helps your audience find the story online.
    
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Vague:** *Officials approve new construction.*
        *   **Specific:** *City approves new subway line construction for 2026.*
    *   **Expected:** A headline that is discoverable via search engines.

**✓ Checkpoint:** You have a 5-10 word headline that is a factual, active-voice statement containing the core angle and primary keywords.
**Verify:** The headline makes sense and conveys the main news even when read completely out of context.

> 💡 **Tips:**
> *   **Use a Strong Verb:** The verb is the engine of the headline. Choose a verb that is active and descriptive (e.g., "approves," "rejects," "launches," "warns").
> *   **Common Mistake:** Writing a "label" headline (e.g., "City Council Budget Meeting"). A headline must have a verb and state what happened.

### Step 3: Write a Cohesive Lead Paragraph

The lead is the logical continuation of the headline. It delivers the most important information in a single, well-structured sentence.

1.  **Adhere to the One-Sentence, 25-40 Word Rule**
    Craft the entire lead as a single, clear sentence. This forces ruthless prioritization.
    
    *   **Details:** If your sentence exceeds 40 words, it's a sign you are including less-critical information. Move supporting details to the second paragraph.
    *   **Expected:** A concise lead that is easy to read and understand in a single glance.

2.  **Prioritize the 5Ws and H**
    Focus on answering the most important 3-4 questions, typically **Who, What, When, and Where**.
    
    *   **Details:** The "Why" and "How" are often more complex and are better explained in the body of the article.
    > ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not start the lead with the "When" or "Where" unless it is the single most important element of the story (e.g., the location of a catastrophic disaster). The "Who" or "What" is almost always more important.
    {: .prompt-warning }

3.  **Place Attribution at the End**
    State the most important fact first, then cite your source at the end of the sentence. This is a critical rule of professional news writing.
    
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Wrong:** *"According to police, a fire caused $2M in damage."*
        *   **Right:** *"A fire caused an estimated $2 million in damage, police said."*
    *   **Expected:** A lead that prioritizes the news, not the source of the news.

4.  **Clarify Acronyms**
    On the first reference, spell out the full name of an organization followed by the acronym in parentheses.
    
    *   **Details:** "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) announced..." Only universally understood acronyms (e.g., FBI, UN) can be used alone in a lead.
    *   **Expected:** A lead that is clear to a general audience, not just insiders.

**✓ Checkpoint:** You have a single sentence, 25-40 words long, that summarizes the most critical facts of the story and correctly places attribution at the end.
**Verify:** The lead paragraph can be published by itself and still provide a complete, basic summary of the news.

> 💡 **Tips:**
> *   **Read it Aloud:** This is the best way to catch awkward phrasing and run-on sentences. If you have to take a breath in the middle, it's too long.
> *   **Common Mistake:** "Backing into the lead" by starting with a subordinate clause (e.g., "In a meeting on Tuesday..."). Get to the main subject and verb immediately.

### Step 4: Review and Finalize

No first draft is perfect. A rigorous, multi-step editing process separates amateur work from professional work.

1.  **Perform a Self-Edit**
    Read the headline and lead aloud. Check for grammar, spelling, and factual accuracy. Cut every unnecessary word.
    
    *   **Details:** Scrutinize adjectives and adverbs. Most can be deleted in hard news writing to maintain objectivity.
    *   **Expected:** A cleaner, tighter draft.

2.  **Conduct an Isolation Review**
    Copy and paste only the headline and lead into a blank document. Read them together, separate from the article.
    
    *   **Details:** Do they align perfectly? Does the lead logically expand on the headline's promise without being redundant? Would a reader on social media understand the story's core from these two elements alone?
    *   **Expected:** Confirmation that your headline and lead work together as a cohesive unit.

3.  **Use the Final Audit Checklist**
    Systematically check your work against all the technical rules discussed in this guide.
    
    *   **Details:** Go through the checklist, ticking off each rule for the headline (concise, active, present tense, etc.) and the lead (one sentence, 25-40 words, attribution last, etc.).
    *   **Expected:** A technically sound headline and lead that adhere to professional standards.

**✓ Checkpoint:** The headline and lead are 100% factually accurate, grammatically correct, and fully aligned in tone and content.
**Verify:** Ask a colleague or editor to review them. A fresh set of eyes is the best final check for errors or lack of clarity you may have missed.

> 💡 **Tips:**
> *   **Consistency is Key:** The tone of the headline must match the tone of the lead and the story. A serious headline demands a serious lead.
> *   **Common Mistake:** The headline makes a promise the lead doesn't keep. If the headline says "scandal erupts," the lead must immediately state the core facts of that scandal.

## Examples

**Example 1: Local Government Story**

*   **Facts:** A fire at the "Star Manufacturing" warehouse on 123 Industrial Road last night caused an estimated $2 million in damage, according to Fire Chief Jane Doe. The cause is under investigation.
*   **Weak Headline:** *Warehouse Fire Investigated* (Label, passive)
*   **Strong Headline:** *Warehouse fire causes $2M in damage* (Active, present tense, uses numeral, includes key impact)
*   **Weak Lead:** *Last night, a fire broke out at a local warehouse. According to Fire Chief Jane Doe, the damage is estimated to be around $2 million.* (Two sentences, starts with "When," attribution at the beginning)
*   **Strong Lead:** *A fire at the Star Manufacturing warehouse on Industrial Road caused an estimated $2 million in damage late Monday night, Fire Chief Jane Doe said.* (One sentence, 26 words, news-first, attribution-last)

**Example 2: National Policy Story**

*   **Facts:** The national government announced Tuesday it is banning the social media app "ConnectU" from all app stores. The reason given is national security risks.
*   **Weak Headline:** *ConnectU App to be Banned* (Passive voice)
*   **Strong Headline:** *Government bans social media app, citing national security* (Active, includes "Why," keyword-rich)
*   **Weak Lead:** *The government announced today that, citing concerns over national security, it would be banning the popular social media app "ConnectU."* (Wordy, buries the main action)
*   **Strong Lead:** *The government is banning the social media app "ConnectU" from all national app stores effective immediately, citing national security risks, officials announced Tuesday.* (One sentence, 28 words, active, concise)

## Best Practices & Pitfalls

**✅ Best Practices:**

*   **Objectivity is Paramount:** Report the facts without emotion or judgment. The power of the story should come from the facts themselves, not from your description of them.
*   **Clarity Above All:** Write for a broad audience, not for insiders. Avoid technical jargon and spell out acronyms on first reference.
*   **Consistency Builds Trust:** Ensure the headline, lead, and body of the article are perfectly aligned. Do not sensationalize the headline for clicks.

**❌ Avoid These:**

*   **The Question Lead:** Never ask a question in a formal news lead. Your job is to provide answers.
*   **The Quote Lead:** Do not start a hard news lead with a direct quote. Paraphrase the key information and save the quote for the body of the article.
*   **The "When" or "Where" Lead:** The "Who" or "What" is almost always more newsworthy. Do not start with the time or location unless it is the most critical element.
*   **Emotional Language:** Avoid adjectives like "shocking," "tragic," or "devastating." Present the facts and let the reader have their own emotional response.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** After writing your lead, try deleting the first few words. Often, writers "warm up" with introductory clauses that can be cut to make the lead more direct and powerful.
