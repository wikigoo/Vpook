### Step 1: Set Up the Production Infrastructure

This foundational step ensures you have the right tools, hardware, and security protocols in place. A robust setup prevents technical issues and protects sensitive journalistic work, forming the backbone of your entire AI-powered workflow.

1.  **Install and Configure the AI Tool Stack**
    
    Select and subscribe to software that is proven to work well with the Persian language.
    
    → **Details:** Set up accounts for your core software stack: **ChatGPT-4** or **Claude 3** for scripting, **Descript** or **Podcastle** for audio editing, **Eleven Labs** for high-quality voice synthesis, and **Auphonic** for automated mastering. Use a tool like **Zapier** to create automated workflows between them where possible (e.g., new script in a folder triggers an audio generation task).
    → **Tool:** ChatGPT, Descript, Auphonic, Zapier.

2.  **Set Up and Test Audio Hardware**
    
    High-quality input is essential for any professional audio work, including training custom voice clones.
    
    → **Details:** Connect your **Shure SM7B** (or an equivalent broadcast-quality) microphone to an **XLR audio interface**. In your recording software (like Descript or Audacity), set the audio input to the interface. Perform a test recording, ensuring your voice peaks between -12 dB and -6 dB for a clean, strong signal.
    
    > ⚠️ **Warning:** Starting with low-quality, noisy, or distorted audio will result in a poor-quality AI voice clone and will make the audio difficult to clean up in post-production.
    {: .prompt-warning }

3.  **Establish a Secure Source Database**
    
    Create a centralized, curated list of credible sources that your AI assistant can use for research.
    
    → **Details:** In a spreadsheet or database application, compile a list of reputable Persian-language sources. Include major news agencies (IRNA, Fars), international Persian services (BBC Persian, VOA Persian), and official government websites. For each source, include the URL and add notes on its general reliability and known political leanings or bias.
    → **Time:** 1-2 hours for the initial setup.

**✓ Checkpoint:** Your hardware is fully tested, software accounts are active, and a curated database of at least 20 credible Persian news sources is compiled.
**Verify:** You have successfully recorded a clean, distortion-free audio sample, and your source list is saved and accessible.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Use a consistent folder structure for every project to keep assets organized, for example: `[Date]_[Topic]/01_Research/`, `.../02_Scripts/`, `.../03_Audio/`.
> *   Avoid using generic, free AI tools that lack specialized support for the Persian language. Investing in professional tools will save significant time and produce a higher-quality result.

### Step 2: Conduct AI-Assisted Research and Planning

In this phase, you will leverage your AI assistant and curated source list to quickly identify newsworthy topics and gather foundational information. This speeds up the editorial planning process and allows journalists to focus on verification and story development.

1.  **Generate an Automated Daily Briefing**
    
    Start each day with an AI-generated summary of key developments.
    
    → **Details:** Use a sophisticated prompt in ChatGPT-4 (with web browsing) or Claude to analyze your source database for news within the last 24 hours. The prompt should instruct the AI to identify trending topics, summarize major events, and highlight emerging keywords.
    → **Tool:** ChatGPT-4 with web browsing.

2.  **Select and Filter Topics**
    
    Apply human editorial judgment to the AI's suggestions.
    
    → **Details:** The editorial team reviews the AI-generated briefing and selects the day's most important stories. Any topic automatically flagged by the AI or identified by the team as politically, culturally, or religiously sensitive must be routed through a manual human review protocol before a script is commissioned.

3.  **Perform AI-Assisted Fact-Checking**
    
    Use the AI to accelerate the verification process, but not to replace it.
    
    → **Details:** For each selected topic, instruct your AI assistant to cross-reference the main claims against at least three different credible sources from your database. The prompt should explicitly ask the AI to identify and list any inconsistencies or contradictions it finds in the reporting.
    
    > ⚠️ **Warning:** The AI's role is to *assist* in gathering information for fact-checking. The final verification and confirmation of all facts remains a non-negotiable human responsibility.
    {: .prompt-warning }

**✓ Checkpoint:** A prioritized list of story topics for the day's production is approved.
**Verify:** You have a documented list of approved topics, and each topic is supported by links to at least three primary sources that corroborate the main claims.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Use highly specific prompts for research. Instead of "research inflation," use: "Summarize the latest reports from Iran's Central Bank and IRNA regarding the official inflation rate for last month, and contrast this with analysis from BBC Persian."
> *   Never fully trust an AI's summary without clicking through and reviewing the primary sources it references. LLMs can occasionally "hallucinate" details.
{: .prompt-info }

> 🔧 **IF PROBLEMS:**
>
> *   If your AI assistant returns generic or irrelevant story suggestions, it's likely your prompt is too broad or your source database needs to be updated with more focused, high-quality links.

### Step 3: Generate and Optimize the Persian Script

This is the most critical stage for ensuring a natural-sounding and culturally appropriate final product. Here, you will generate the script and then meticulously format it to guide the AI text-to-speech engine.

1.  **Generate the First Draft with a Structured Prompt**
    
    Use detailed, culturally-aware prompts to create a strong initial script.
    
    → **Details:** In ChatGPT or Claude, use a Persian-language prompt template that specifies the desired tone (e.g., "authoritative but accessible"), format (e.g., "breaking news report"), and incorporates cultural framing (e.g., starting with an "آغاز گرم" or warm opening). For complex investigative stories, use prompt chaining to build the narrative in logical stages.
    → **Tool:** Claude 3 (recommended for longer, more nuanced content) or ChatGPT-4.

2.  **Apply Strategic Diacritization for Pronunciation**
    
    This is the key to accurate AI voice generation in Persian.
    
    → **Details:** Manually edit the generated Persian text. Add **`اعراب`** (diacritical marks) *only where necessary* to prevent mispronunciation. Focus on three areas:
    1.  **Ambiguous words:** where meaning changes with vowels (e.g., `مُدَرِّسه` for "female teacher" vs. `مَدرَسه` for "school").
    2.  **Foreign names and places:** to guide the pronunciation (e.g., `واشینگتَن`).
    3.  **Technical terms.**

3.  **Format the Script with Audio Optimization Cues**
    
    Embed specific commands directly into the text to control the AI voice's delivery and guide the audio production process.
    
    → **Details:** Add the following markers to your script:
    *   **Breathing:** `[نفس]` for a short pause.
    *   **Emphasis:** `[تأکید]` before a word that needs to be stressed.
    *   **Pacing:** `[سریع]` or `[آرام]` to control the speed of a phrase.
    *   **Technical:** `[موسیقی ورودی - ۵ ثانیه]` for production cues.
    → **Time:** 30-60 minutes per 5-minute script.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A final script is editorially approved, with all necessary diacritics and audio optimization cues embedded in the text.
**Verify:** The marked-up script is reviewed by at least one other Persian-speaking colleague to ensure the cues are logical and the diacritics are correct.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Maintain a separate glossary document of commonly used foreign names and technical terms with their correct Persian diacritization. This saves time and ensures consistency across all scripts.
> *   Avoid the mistake of adding diacritics to every single word. This is unnecessary and can sometimes confuse the TTS engine, leading to a less natural, more robotic cadence.
{: .prompt-info }

> 🔧 **IF PROBLEMS:**
>
> *   If an AI voice engine consistently mispronounces a specific word despite correct diacritics, try spelling the word phonetically in Persian as a last resort (e.g., using different letter combinations that force the desired sound).

### Step 4: Produce and Enhance the Audio

In this phase, you will convert your optimized script into a broadcast-quality audio file. This involves generating the voice, applying audio processing tailored for Persian, mixing, and mastering.

1.  **Generate the Voice Track**
    
    Use your optimized script to create the raw voice recording.
    
    → **Details:** If you are using a custom voice clone, ensure it was trained on at least 15-20 minutes of clean, high-quality, and tonally varied Persian audio. Paste your final, marked-up script from Step 3 into your chosen text-to-speech tool to generate the main voice track.
    → **Tool:** Eleven Labs (for highest quality) or Descript's Overdub feature.

2.  **Apply a Persian-Specific EQ Profile**
    
    Enhance the clarity and warmth of the Persian narration using an equalizer (EQ).
    
    → **Details:** In your audio editor (e.g., Descript, Adobe Audition), apply an EQ to the voice track. Start with these settings and adjust by ear:
    *   **High-Pass Filter:** Cut frequencies below 80-120 Hz to remove low-end rumble.
    *   **Clarity Boost:** Apply a gentle boost in the 2-8 kHz range to enhance consonant articulation and clarity.
    → **Tool:** Descript, Adobe Audition, Audacity.

3.  **Mix in Background Audio**
    
    Add background music or sound effects to create a professional soundscape.
    
    → **Details:** Place any background music on a separate audio track. Set its volume level to be significantly lower than the narration, typically between **-20 dB and -25 dB** relative to the voice track's peak level. Use automation to "duck" the music volume slightly when the narration is present.
    
    > ⚠️ **Warning:** Avoid using music with prominent vocals or complex melodies, as this will compete with the Persian narration and distract the listener. Simple, instrumental beds work best.
    {: .prompt-warning }

4.  **Master the Final Audio File**
    
    This is the final polish that ensures your podcast sounds professional and consistent.
    
    → **Details:** Export your mixed audio file (narration + music) and process it through **Auphonic**. Use a preset for "Podcast" and ensure the target loudness is set to **-16 LUFS** (the industry standard). This will automatically apply loudness normalization, noise reduction, and other enhancements.
    → **Tool:** Auphonic.

**✓ Checkpoint:** A final, broadcast-quality, mixed, and mastered audio file (typically a high-bitrate MP3 or WAV) is complete.
**Verify:** Listen to the final audio file on multiple different devices (e.g., high-quality headphones, car speakers, phone speaker) to ensure it sounds clear, balanced, and professional in all common listening environments.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Always generate your initial voice track in a high-quality, lossless format like WAV. This gives you the best quality source material to work with during mixing and mastering.
> *   Never skip the mastering step. Unmastered audio will have inconsistent volume levels between segments and will sound amateurish compared to other professional podcasts.
{: .prompt-info }

> 🔧 **IF PROBLEMS:**
>
> *   If the mastered audio sounds too harsh or the "s" sounds are piercing (sibilance), return to the EQ step in your editor and slightly reduce the frequencies in the 5-8 kHz range before re-mastering.
{: .prompt-info }

### Step 5: Implement Quality Control and Distribute

Before your content reaches the audience, it must pass a final, rigorous quality control check. This step ensures journalistic integrity, cultural appropriateness, and a polished final presentation across all platforms.

1.  **Conduct a Multi-Tier Content Review**
    
    Implement a formal review process that combines automated checks with essential human oversight.
    
    → **Details:** Before publishing, the final audio and all accompanying text (show notes, social media posts) must pass through a three-tier review:
    1.  **Automated Check:** Run all text through a Persian spell and grammar checker.
    2.  **Editorial Review:** A human editor verifies adherence to journalistic standards and cultural appropriateness.
    3.  **Senior Approval:** A senior editor gives the final sign-off before publication.

2.  **Add a Transparent AI Usage Disclosure**
    
    Maintain audience trust by being open about your production methods.
    
    → **Details:** In the podcast episode description or show notes, include a brief, clear statement about the use of AI.
    → **Example Text:** `این گزارش با کمک ابزارهای هوش مصنوعی تهیه و توسط تیم تحریریه به طور کامل بازبینی و تایید شده است.` (This report was prepared with the assistance of AI tools and has been fully reviewed and approved by the editorial team.)

3.  **Generate and Post Multi-Format Outputs**
    
    Maximize the reach of your content by adapting it for different platforms.
    
    → **Details:** Use the final mastered audio as the core asset. Create a standard **16:9** audiogram video (with a static image and waveform) for YouTube. Create a vertical, captioned **9:16** video clip of a key highlight for Instagram Reels, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts.
    → **Time:** 20-40 minutes.

**✓ Checkpoint:** The final, fully-vetted content package is published and accessible on all target platforms.
**Verify:** Check the live URLs for your podcast episode, YouTube video, and social media posts to confirm that the content is playing correctly and all accompanying text, subtitles, and metadata are displayed as intended.

> 💡 **Tips:**
>
> *   Create a pre-publication checklist in your project management tool to ensure no step—from final fact-checking to adding the AI disclosure—is ever missed.
> *   Don't publish to all platforms at the exact same time. Schedule your posts to align with the peak user activity times for your target audience on each specific platform.
{: .prompt-info }

> 🔧 **IF PROBLEMS:**
>
> *   If a platform's automated content filter incorrectly flags your news report (e.g., for sensitive content), immediately file an appeal through the platform's official channel and provide context, explaining that it is a verified journalistic piece from a reputable news organization.

## Examples

### Example: Breaking News Script Optimization

**Context:** A 60-second breaking news report about new economic sanctions. The goal is a clear, urgent, and accurate AI-voiced segment.

**Step 3 (Scripting) in Action:**

*   **Initial AI Draft (from Claude):**
    `ایالات متحده تحریم های جدیدی را علیه بخش بانکی ایران اعمال کرد. این اقدام بر چندین بانک تاثیر می گذارد. کارشناسان نگران تاثیر آن بر مردم عادی هستند.`
    (The United States imposed new sanctions on Iran's banking sector. This action affects several banks. Experts are concerned about the impact on ordinary people.)

*   **Optimized Script (after human editing):**
    `خبرِ فوری: [تأکید] ایالاتِ متحده تَحریم‌هایِ [تأکید] جدیدی را علیهِ بخشِ بانکیِ ایران اِعمال کَرد. [نفس] این اِقدام، چند بانکِ خصوصی و دُولتی را هَدَف قَرار داده است. [نفس] کارشناسان نِگَرانِ تأثیرِ این تَحریم‌ها بَر زِندگیِ روزمَرِّهِ مَردُم هَستَند. [موسیقی پایانی]`
    (Breaking News: The United States imposed **new** sanctions against Iran's banking sector. [breath] This action has targeted several private and state-owned banks. [breath] Experts are concerned about the impact of these sanctions on the daily lives of the people. [outro music])

**Result:** The optimized script adds urgency (`خبرِ فوری`), uses diacritics for clearer pronunciation (`تَحریم‌هایِ`, `اِعمال`), adds emphasis (`[تأکید]`) on key words, and includes breathing pauses (`[نفس]`) for a more natural delivery. This level of detail transforms a robotic reading into a professional news report.

## Best Practices & Common Mistakes

**✅ Best Practices:**

*   **Human Oversight is Central:** Treat AI as a powerful assistant, not a replacement for journalistic judgment. Every piece of AI-generated content must be vetted by a human editor.
*   **Create a Pronunciation Glossary:** Maintain a shared document with the correct diacritization for frequently used but hard-to-pronounce names, places, and technical terms.
*   **Master in Batches:** To save time and cost with tools like Auphonic, process several audio segments together as a batch production at the end of your session.

**❌ Avoid These:**

*   **Trusting AI Facts:** Never take a factual claim from an AI assistant at face value. Always verify it against multiple primary sources.
*   **Skipping the Mastering Step:** Publishing unmastered audio with inconsistent volume levels is one of the quickest ways to sound unprofessional.
*   **Using a Generic Voice for Everything:** A serious political analysis should not use the same vocal tone as a human-interest story. Use the AI tool's settings to adjust tone, or use different voice models for different types of content.
