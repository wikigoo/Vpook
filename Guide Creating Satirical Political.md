# Guide: Creating Satirical Political-Social Monologues in Persian

> **Purpose:** This guide teaches you to transform daily observations into 2-3 minute satirical monologues using the Persian "frustrated observer" voice. You'll learn to combine formal literary language with street colloquialisms, escalate through strategic exaggeration, and maintain ethical boundaries while delivering sharp social commentary.

## Overview

Satirical political-social monologues (مونوگ طنز سیاسی‌-اجتماعی) represent a distinct Persian literary tradition where a single narrator critiques contemporary issues through humor, exaggeration, and linguistic play. Unlike Western stand-up comedy or academic political analysis, this form occupies a unique space: entertaining enough for social media consumption yet substantive enough to spark reflection.

The core technique revolves around **language contrast** (تضاد مقدس) - the collision between formal Persian literary language and crude street vernacular. When formal phrases like "چشم به جهان گشودم" (I opened my eyes to the world) slam into crude expressions like "کونونی‌مان پاره شده" (our asses are torn), the jarring juxtaposition creates both humor and critique. This linguistic whiplash signals that something is absurd about the situation being described.

The narrator typically embodies a **کلافه‌ی آگاه** (frustrated aware observer) - an ordinary person who sees through contradictions but responds with dark humor rather than despair. This voice maintains enough distance to observe clearly while remaining relatable enough for audience identification.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Develop a consistent satirical narrator voice
- Structure monologues using the three-act framework
- Apply exaggeration techniques that maintain internal logic
- Create signature opening/closing sequences
- Balance critique with entertainment value
- Navigate ethical boundaries in political satire

**Prerequisites:**
- Native or advanced fluency in Persian (both formal and colloquial registers)
- Understanding of current Iranian political/economic/social context
- Access to Iranian news sources and social media
- 90-120 minutes per monologue

**Key Terms:**
- **کلافه‌ی آگاه** (Frustrated Aware One): The narrator archetype - ordinary, slightly pessimistic, very intelligent
- **تضاد مقدس** (Sacred Contrast): The formal/colloquial language collision technique
- **اغراق با منطق** (Exaggeration with Logic): Escalating absurdity while maintaining traceable logic
- **همین دیگه** (That's It): The signature closing phrase signaling end of rant

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Define Core Elements

Before writing a single word, establish your satirical framework. These decisions shape every subsequent choice and maintain consistency throughout your piece.

1. **Identify Target Audience and Platform**

   Your audience demographics determine acceptable language boundaries and reference points.
   
   - **Young internet users (18-35):** Instagram/Telegram platform, highly colloquial acceptable, current memes/trends
   - **Formal podcast listeners (30-50):** More measured language, deeper political analysis, historical context
   - **General public (all ages):** Mixed media, balance formal/casual, universal references
   
   Write one-sentence audience profile: "My audience is [age] [platform users] who [relationship to topic]"
   
   > ⚠️ **Warning:** Colloquial expressions that work for young audiences can alienate formal listeners. Choose your register early.
   {: .prompt-warning }

2. **Select Narrator Archetype**

   Choose ONE voice and maintain it consistently:
   
   **کلافه‌ی بدبین** (Pessimistic Cynic):
   - Expects worst outcomes
   - Uses dark sarcasm
   - Example phrases: "دیگه خیلی گاییدیم" (we're really screwed), "چه انتظاری داشتید؟" (what did you expect?)
   
   **ساده‌لوح پرسشگر** (Naive Questioner):
   - Asks innocent questions exposing absurdity
   - Creates dramatic irony
   - Example phrases: "یعنی این خوبه؟" (so this is good?), "من یه چیزی نمیفهمم" (I don't understand something)
   
   **دانای شوخ‌طبع** (Informed Joker):
   - Knowledgeable but playful
   - Balances facts with humor
   - Example phrases: "بذار برات بگم چیشده" (let me tell you what happened), "حالا ببینید" (now watch this)

   Write 2-3 signature phrases your chosen narrator would repeatedly use.

3. **Choose Concrete Observable Topic**

   Select from these proven categories:
   
   - **Social criticism:** Instagram ads, fashion trends, influencer behavior, dating culture
   - **Economic-political:** Inflation, currency crisis, official contradictory statements, policy absurdities
   - **Technology:** New app trends, algorithm changes, digital culture shifts
   
   **Topic requirements:**
   - Something audience saw/experienced in last 7 days
   - Tangible and specific (not abstract concepts)
   - Contains inherent contradiction or absurdity
   
   > 💡 **Tip:** Repetitive topics work if your angle is fresh. Don't avoid common subjects - find the unspoken truth about them.
   {: .prompt-info }

4. **Write Single-Sentence Thesis**

   Formula: `[Group/situation] + [action/state] + [reveals/proves] + [underlying truth]`
   
   Examples:
   - "National joy and success is the biggest defeat for enemy propaganda"
   - "Gold-buying tradition reveals it's actually a jealousy competition"
   - "Contradictory Instagram advice proves no one actually knows anything"

5. **Identify Core Conflict**

   Every strong monologue needs dramatic tension. Choose one:
   
   - **Our will vs their propaganda:** Public genuine emotion vs media narrative
   - **Truth vs lies:** Reality everyone sees vs official statements
   - **Law vs reality:** Policy on paper vs lived experience
   - **Strong vs weak (unexpected outcome):** Underdog victory exposing power pretensions
   
   Write as equation: "[Our side] VS [Their side] = [Ironic result]"

**✓ Checkpoint:** You can explain topic, narrator voice, and thesis in 60 seconds  
**Verify:** Record yourself explaining these elements - should feel natural and conversational

---

### Step 2: Gather Ammunition (Facts and Details)

Strong satire requires factual anchors. Gather evidence before writing.

1. **Collect 2-3 "Punching Stats"**

   Numbers that tell story without explanation:
```
   Comparative: "Iran 180 points, America 18 points"
   Extreme figures: "Price increased 500% in 3 months"
   Timeline: "3 months without Minister of Economy"
```
   
   **Source requirement:** Official news, government sites, verified reports only
   
   **Time:** 15 minutes research
   
   > ⚠️ **Warning:** NEVER fabricate statistics presented as real. This destroys all credibility permanently and contributes to misinformation ecosystem.
   {: .prompt-warning }

2. **Extract 1-2 Key Quotes**

   Find verbatim statements from officials, media, or public figures that reveal contradictions:
   
   - Keep under 15 words for easy recall
   - Must contain inherent absurdity or contradiction
   - Example: "Why are Iranians happy despite all these problems?" (from foreign media)

3. **Note 3-5 Concrete Objects/Experiences**

   Ground abstract concepts in daily life using tangible vocabulary:
   
   **Vocabulary bank:**
   - Household: سرویس قابلمه (pot set), کولر آبی (evaporative cooler), تخت دو طبقه (bunk bed)
   - Tech: LCD گوشی (phone LCD), رم کامپیوتر (computer RAM)
   - Food: سیب‌زمینی (potato), آب‌هویج (carrot juice), کالباس (bologna)
   - Urban: صف نانوایی (bakery queue), کپسول گاز (gas capsule)
   
   **Rule:** If a child wouldn't recognize the object, it's too specialized

4. **Identify Unexpected Comparison**

   Find completely unrelated phenomenon for ironic juxtaposition:
   
   Example: "Purple spider discovery in Australia" vs "War casualties in Middle East"
   
   Purpose: Highlight media priority distortions

**✓ Checkpoint:** You have minimum 3 factual anchors + 4 concrete objects  
**Verify:** Can you visualize each element? Can audience picture it without explanation?

> 💡 **Tips:**
> - Punch lines come from data contradicting official narrative
> - Original sources (government, research) stronger than news aggregators
> - Most absurd facts need no exaggeration - just present them accurately
{: .prompt-info }

---

### Step 3: Construct Opening Hook (30 seconds / ~100 words)

The opening determines whether audience continues listening. Make it immediate and surprising.

1. **Write Signature Opening**
```
   سلام علیکم.
```
   
   - **Never deviate** from this greeting
   - Period after, not exclamation mark
   - New paragraph immediately following
   
   This consistency becomes brand identity for loyal audiences.

2. **Present Observation Using Discovery Format**

   Choose one template:
```
   "امروز همین‌جوری داشتم [action] که دیدم..."
   (Today while [doing X] I saw...)
   
   "می‌دونستید [surprising fact]? جدی."
   (Did you know [fact]? Seriously.)
   
   "[Topic] - یهو فکرم رفت..."
   ([Topic] - suddenly I thought...)
```
   
   **Tone:** Surprised discovery, NOT academic introduction
   
   **Length:** 2-3 sentences maximum

3. **Apply Language Contrast Formula**

   **Formula:** Formal/poetic phrase + Crude/colloquial expression = Satirical punch
   
   **Working examples:**
```
   "در این مملکت چشم به جهان گشودم"
   (In this country I opened my eyes to the world - FORMAL)
   → 
   "کونونی‌مان پاره شده"
   (Our asses are torn - CRUDE)
   
   "شرایط حساس کنونی"
   (Current sensitive conditions - FORMAL)
   →
   "دیگه خیلی گاییدیم"
   (We're really fucked - CRUDE)
   
   "با حفظ شأن و منزلت"
   (Maintaining dignity and status - FORMAL)
   →
   "یه چیز دیگه بگو بخندیم"
   (Say something else so we can laugh - CASUAL)
```
   
   > ⚠️ **Warning:** Contrast must be jarring. Same register throughout kills the effect completely.
   {: .prompt-warning }

4. **Use Amplifier Words**

   Increase energy with: کلاً, اصلاً, دیگه, یعنی, واقعاً, جدی, همینجوری
   
   **Placement:** Before key observation or after rhetorical question
   
   **Frequency:** 2-3 times in opening paragraph

**✓ Checkpoint:** Opening grabs attention in first 10 seconds and establishes tone  
**Verify:** Read aloud - does it feel like excited friend sharing discovery? Or like news report?

> 💡 **Common mistake:** Academic tone in opening kills engagement immediately. If you're explaining context, you've already lost.
{: .prompt-info }

---

### Step 4: Develop Middle Section (90-120 seconds / ~250 words)

This is where observation becomes satire through escalation. Choose ONE technique and commit fully.

1. **Select Primary Escalation Technique**

   **Technique A - Absurd Cause-Effect Chain:**
   
   Build logical progression where each conclusion becomes increasingly ridiculous:
```
   Reality: Instagram hashtags no longer work
   ↓
   Consequence 1: One expert says post at midnight
   ↓
   Consequence 2: Another says outfit color matters
   ↓
   Consequence 3: Another says cast spells
   ↓
   Result: COMPLETE INFORMATION CHAOS
```
   
   **Best for:** Policy topics, economic issues, bureaucracy
   
   ---
   
   **Technique B - Fictional Dialogue:**
   
   Create conversation between absent characters using their speech patterns:
```persian
   حالا یکی میاد میگه: "باید طلا بخری"
   (Now someone comes and says: "You must buy gold")
   
   که باید بگم: "کدوم طلا؟ همون که قیمتش سه برابر شد؟"
   (To which I must say: "Which gold? The one that tripled in price?")
```
   
   **Format:** "حالا یکی میاد میگه: '[view]' / که باید بگم: '[response]'"
   
   **Best for:** Social behavior topics, cultural trends, relationship dynamics
   
   ---
   
   **Technique C - Unexpected Comparison:**
   
   Juxtapose serious topic with trivial/absurd news to show priority distortion:
```
   Media coverage: Purple spider discovered in Australia
   vs
   Media silence: Daily casualties in regional war
```
   
   **Best for:** Media criticism, news priority topics

2. **Escalate Through Three Clear Stages**

   Maintain visible logical chain connecting reality to absurdity:
   
   - **Stage 1 (Reality):** Present situation using your gathered facts - no exaggeration
   - **Stage 2 (Mild exaggeration):** Stretch proportions 2-3x - still believable
   - **Stage 3 (Absurd extreme):** Push to ridiculous conclusion - obviously impossible but logically traceable
   
   > ⚠️ **Critical:** If internal logic breaks, audience loses thread. Absurd must be traceable back to reality step-by-step.
   {: .prompt-warning }

3. **Inject 3-5 Rhetorical Questions**

   Drive narrative forward with:
```
   "فکر کردی چی شد؟" (Thought what happened?)
   "می‌فهمی یعنی چی؟" (You understand what this means?)
   "حالا ببینید چی شده" (Now see what happened)
   "یهو فکرم رفت" (Suddenly I thought)
```
   
   **Placement:** Before major escalations or after surprising facts
   
   **Tone:** Not waiting for answer - rhetorical propulsion

4. **Use Colloquial Expressions for Authenticity**

   Essential phrases for maintaining street credibility:
   
   - "بدجور" (badly/seriously)
   - "یعنی کاری کرد کارستان" (really did something remarkable)
   - "نونشون تو خون دل خوردنه" (their bread is eaten with heartblood - suffering for basic needs)
   - "قصه از اینجا شروع شد" (the story starts here)
   
   **Frequency:** Every 2-3 sentences
   
   **Purpose:** Prevents formal drift, maintains conversational feel

5. **Address Audience Directly**

   Create intimacy and shared frustration:
   
   - "برادر من" (my brother)
   - "بذار برات بگم" (let me tell you)
   - "آخه یکی نیست به اینا بگه" (isn't there someone to tell them)
   
   **Frequency:** 2-3 times in middle section

6. **Structure Sentences for Performance**
```
   Length: Maximum 15-20 words per sentence
   Complexity: Avoid subordinate clauses
   Rhythm: Short-short-short-medium pattern
   Punctuation: Commas for breath, ellipses (...) for thought pauses
```
   
   **Test:** If you run out of breath reading aloud, sentence is too long

7. **Build Rapid-Fire Contradiction Lists**

   Create information overload feeling:
```
   "اون میگه نیمه‌شب پست بذار,
   اون یکی میگه رنگ لباس مهمه,
   اون دیگه میگه تور بنداز..."
   
   (One says post midnight,
   Another says outfit color matters,
   Another says cast a spell...)
```
   
   **Length:** Minimum 3 items, maximum 7
   
   **Purpose:** Demonstrates confusion and chaos of contradictory advice

**✓ Checkpoint:** Middle section advances either exaggeration OR reveals new contradiction in each paragraph  
**Verify:** Apply "So What?" test - after each paragraph ask "Does this prove my thesis or add excitement?" If no, cut it.

> 💡 **Troubleshooting:**
> - Middle drags? Cut 30% and speed rhythm with shorter sentences
> - Exaggeration feels disconnected? Add transition: "حالا ببینید" (now watch)
> - Losing narrative thread? Return to core conflict and restate in new words
{: .prompt-info }

---

### Step 5: Write Closing Signature (30 seconds / ~80 words)

The closing must feel like natural exhaustion - friend ending a rant.

1. **Deliver Philosophical Punch Line**

   Timing: Immediately before signature closing
   
   **Formula:** `[If X weren't true], [I would complain about Y]. جدی` (Seriously.)
   
   **Examples:**
```
   "یعنی اگه یه زندگیِ دیگه نباشه، من یکی خیلی شاکی می‌شم. جدی."
   (If there's no other life, I'll really complain. Seriously.)
   
   "اگه یه روز بدون خبر بد بشه، فکر میکنم دنیا داره تموم میشه."
   (If one day passes without bad news, I'll think the world is ending.)
```
   
   **Purpose:** Gives audience quotable takeaway, summarizes entire observation

2. **Execute Three-Part Signature Closing**

   **NEVER deviate from this structure:**
   
   **Part A - Sudden Wrap:**
```
   همین دیگه...
   (That's it...)
```
   
   **Part B - Mundane Observation:**
   
   Completely unrelated trivial fact showing life continues:
```
   "برقا همش قطعه"
   (Electricity keeps cutting)
   
   "گربه محله‌مون چهار تا زایید که تو کوچه ولن"
   (Neighborhood cat had four kittens wandering the alley)
   
   "دالر که رفته بالا, هوام که کثافته"
   (Dollar went up, weather's filthy too)
```
   
   **Rules:**
   - Must be unrelated to main topic
   - Must be something you actually observed
   - Tone: Resigned acceptance
   
   **Part C - Audience Question:**
```
   شما چه خبر؟
   (What's your news?)
```
   
   > ⚠️ **Warning:** Signature closing is brand identity. Changing confuses loyal audiences who expect this exact structure.
   {: .prompt-warning }

**✓ Checkpoint:** Closing brings energy down naturally and signals clear end  
**Verify:** Does it feel like friend signing off vent session? Not formal conclusion?

---

### Step 6: Performance Revision (20-30 minutes)

Transform written script into performable piece.

1. **Read Aloud at Performance Speed**
```
   Tool: Phone voice recorder
   Speed: Fast, energetic, almost breathless
   Action: Mark every stumble or slowdown
   Time: 5 minutes first read
```

2. **Rewrite Problem Sections**

   Common issues and fixes:
   
   | Issue | Solution |
   |-------|----------|
   | Rhythm drops | Replace long words with short ones |
   | Lose breath | Split sentence or remove subordinate clause |
   | Tongue-twister | Simplify consonant clusters |
   
   **Test:** Reread problem section 3 times - should flow smoothly by third attempt

3. **Strengthen Weak Vocabulary**

   Upgrade patterns for impact:
```
   ❌ "پیروزی بزرگ" (big victory)
   ✅ "اقتدار مطلق" (absolute dominance)
   
   ❌ "ناراحت شدند" (became upset)
   ✅ "دیوانه شدند" (went crazy)
   ✅ "از عصبانیت به هم پیچیدند" (twisted in anger)
   
   ❌ "مشکل دارد" (has problem)
   ✅ "فاجعه است" (is disaster)
```
   
   **Rule:** Choose word matching narrator's emotional intensity
   
   **Target:** Upgrade 3-5 words per monologue

4. **Apply "So What?" Test**

   For each paragraph ask: "Does this prove my thesis OR add excitement OR reveal contradiction?"
   
   **Action:** If answer is no, delete or combine with adjacent paragraph
   
   **Expected result:** Should cut 10-15% of content
   
   > 💡 **Tip:** Most writers keep 20% too much content. Aggressive cutting improves pacing dramatically.
   {: .prompt-info }

5. **Count and Verify Language Contrasts**

   **Requirement:** Minimum 3 formal/colloquial contrasts in full piece
   
   **Distribution:**
   - At least 1 in opening (mandatory)
   - At least 1 in middle (mandatory)
   - 1 optional in closing
   
   **Quality check:** Does contrast feel surprising? If expected, doesn't count

6. **Final Performance Test**
```
   1. Record yourself performing entire piece
   2. Listen without script
   3. Check: Narrator personality consistent?
   4. Check: Energy matches content?
   5. Check: Any dead spots?
```

**✓ Checkpoint:** You can perform entire piece smoothly in 2-3 minutes without losing energy  
**Verify:** Record and time - should be 120-180 seconds for optimal platform performance

---

### Step 7: Ethics and Fact Verification (15 minutes)

Final safeguard against misinformation and harm.

1. **Verify Accuracy of All Factual Claims**
```
   Process: Check each statistic, quote, date, name against original source
   Standard: Can you provide source URL if challenged?
   Action: Either verify OR make obviously fictional
```
   
   > ⚠️ **Critical:** One false "fact" destroys credibility permanently. Audiences have long memories for being misled.
   {: .prompt-warning }

2. **Evaluate Targets of Criticism**

   For each joke/critique ask:
   
   **"Am I attacking behavior/policy OR attacking person's identity/attributes?"**
   
   ✅ **GOOD - Critique positions:**
   - Official's contradictory statements
   - Absurd economic policy
   - Hypocritical media coverage
   
   ❌ **BAD - Attack identity:**
   - Physical appearance
   - Ethnic background
   - Disability or illness
   - Poverty itself (vs policies causing poverty)
   
   **Test:** "Would this joke work if I changed the target's identity?"
   - If no = you're targeting identity not behavior

3. **Check Clarity of Satirical Intent**

   Text-based satire lacks vocal cues and can be misunderstood.
   
   **Risk mitigation:**
   - Add signal phrases: "یعنی" (meaning - sarcastic), "البته" (of course - ironic)
   - Make exaggeration SO extreme it's clearly impossible
   - Test with someone unfamiliar with topic
   
   **Question:** "Is it unmistakable that I'm being satirical?"

4. **Distinguish Obvious Exaggeration from Fake News**
```
   ✅ GOOD: "Gold buying is international shining competition"
   (Obviously metaphorical)
   
   ❌ BAD: "Government announced 500% salary increase"
   (Could be misread as false news claim)
```
   
   **Rule:** Exaggeration must be SO extreme it's clearly impossible
   
   **Action:** If boundary unclear, add absurd detail making fiction obvious

5. **Final Conscience Check**

   Ask yourself:
   
   - [ ] Would I find this fair if I were in the audience?
   - [ ] Does this punch down at vulnerable people or up at power?
   - [ ] Am I using satire platform for personal vendetta vs social commentary?
   - [ ] Does piece aim for improvement or just destruction?
   
   **Standard:** If ANY answer makes you uncomfortable, revise that section
   
   **Tool:** Imagine your most respected elder hearing this - would you be proud?

**✓ Checkpoint:** All facts verified, critique targets justified, satirical intent clear, conscience satisfied  
**Verify:** Can you defend every joke rationally if challenged by thoughtful critic?

> 💡 **Ethical principle:** Best satire targets those with power, not those without. One offensive joke ruins 100 good ones - audiences remember wounds.

## Examples

### Example 1: Women and Gold Tradition

**Context:** Annual tradition of buying gold jewelry for women on International Women's Day, often leading to social comparison.

**Opening:**
```persian
سلام علیکم.
امروز تبلیغ یه طلافروشی رو دیدم که نوشته بود: "روز زن نزدیکه، بیاید طلا بخرید".
```

**Escalation (Cause-Effect Chain):**
```
Observation: Shops advertise gold buying
↓
Question: Why must we buy gold every women's day?
↓
Realization: It's actually a competition
↓
Exaggeration: "Global shining competition" - who can display more gold
↓
Truth revealed: About jealousy and comparison, not appreciation
```

**Key Technique:** Mock business analysis of gold shops (treating social ritual like economic transaction)

**Closing:**
```persian
همین دیگه... هوام که کثافته، دالر هم که رفته بالا.
شما چه خبر؟
```

**Why It Works:** Exposes unspoken truth (gift-giving as social competition) through economic lens, uses absurd escalation to make invisible pattern visible.

---

### Example 2: Instagram Algorithm Confusion

**Context:** Conflicting advice from Instagram growth "experts" about how to beat the algorithm.

**Opening:**
```persian
سلام علیکم.
امروز داشتم تو اکسپلور می‌چرخیدم که دیدم یکی نوشته: "هشتگ مُرده".
```

**Escalation (Rapid-Fire List):**
```persian
یکی میگه هشتگ بذار.
اون یکی میگه نیمه‌شب پست بذار.
اون یکی میگه رنگ لباس مهمه.
اون یکی میگه تور بنداز.
اون یکی میگه...
```

**Key Technique:** Contradiction list creating information chaos, demonstrates absurdity through enumeration

**Closing:**
```persian
یعنی اگه یه زندگیِ دیگه نباشه، من یکی خیلی شاکی می‌شم.
همین دیگه... گربه محله‌مون چهار تا زایید.
شما چه خبر؟
```

**Why It Works:** Relatable frustration, exposes how "expert advice" is actually random guessing, exhaustion expressed through accumulation.

---

### Example 3: Missing Economic Minister

**Context:** Period when Iran had no designated Minister of Economy, yet economic decisions continued.

**Opening:**
```persian
سلام علیکم.
می‌دونستید ما الان وزیر اقتصاد نداریم? جدی. یعنی نه کلاً.
```

**Escalation (Naive Questioning):**
```persian
یکی نیست بگه: "ببخشید، وزیر هست?"
میگن: "نه دیگه، کار نکرد."
"خب حالا باید باشه که."
"نه، اونایی که باختن، وزیرو زدن که رُخ نگه دارن."
```

**Key Technique:** Innocent questions exposing bureaucratic absurdity, using naive narrator to highlight surreal normality

**Closing:**
```persian
همین دیگه... برقا همش قطعه.
شما چه خبر؟
```

**Why It Works:** Simple logic (economy needs minister) collides with absurd reality (functioning without one), exposes normalization of chaos.

---

## Best Practices

**✅ Do These:**

- **Start writing immediately after observing trigger event** - fresh frustration produces authentic voice
- **Maintain single narrator personality throughout** - consistency builds audience trust
- **Read every draft aloud minimum 3 times** - writing rhythm differs from speaking rhythm
- **Cut 10-15% after first draft** - most writers include too much, pacing suffers
- **Use concrete objects over abstract concepts** - "سیب‌زمینی" beats "inflation" for relatability
- **Let internal logic guide exaggeration** - absurd conclusion must be traceable to real premise
- **Test language contrasts for surprise factor** - if collision feels expected, push further
- **Ground piece in verifiable facts** - even exaggerated satire needs factual anchor

**❌ Avoid These:**

- **Never fabricate statistics presented as real** - destroys credibility permanently
- **Don't mix multiple escalation techniques** - causes confusion, weakens impact
- **Avoid targeting vulnerable individuals/groups** - punch up at power, not down at powerless
- **Don't sacrifice internal logic for bigger laugh** - if exaggeration breaks logic chain, audience loses thread
- **Never use academic tone in opening** - kills engagement within seconds
- **Don't change signature opening/closing** - loyal audiences expect consistency
- **Avoid subordinate clauses in sentences** - complex grammar kills performance rhythm
- **Don't write without clear thesis** - random complaints without argument = ineffective sloganeering

> 💡 **Pro Insight:** The difference between successful satire and failed sloganeering is the *logic chain*. Audience must be able to trace your absurd conclusion back to reality step-by-step. If chain breaks, you lose them.

## Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Diagnosis | Solution |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Not funny | Insufficient exaggeration or language contrast | Add 2+ formal/crude collisions, push exaggeration one stage further |
| Too silly/unbelievable | Internal logic broken | Rebuild cause-effect chain with visible steps |
| Boring/flat energy | Rhythm too slow, sentences too long | Cut 20%, maximum 15 words per sentence |
| Confusing | Multiple techniques mixed | Choose ONE: cause-effect OR dialogue OR comparison |
| Feels mean | Targeting identity not behavior | Refocus critique on actions/policies |
| Audience lost | Thesis unclear | State thesis explicitly early, return to it regularly |
| Dead spots in middle | Paragraph doesn't advance story | Apply "So What?" test, cut failing paragraphs |
| Weak closing | Missing signature structure | Restore three-part closing: همین دیگه + mundane + شما چه خبر |
