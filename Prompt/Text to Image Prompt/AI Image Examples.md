## 5. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT)
```
✅ Best for: Natural language, text rendering, conversational editing
✅ Strengths: Understands complex descriptions, automatic enhancement
❌ Limitations: Less style control, no seeds, slower iterations

Optimization:
- Use descriptive natural language
- Be specific about composition and lighting
- Let auto-enhancement work (don't over-specify)
- Request specific aspect ratios explicitly
```

### Midjourney
```
✅ Best for: Artistic styles, consistent series, aesthetic quality
✅ Strengths: Style tuner, seeds, parameter control, v6 quality
❌ Limitations: Discord interface, text rendering, learning curve

Optimization:
- Always use --v 6 for latest quality
- Set --s (stylize) 0-1000 based on creativity desired
- Use --seed for series consistency
- Leverage --iw for image references
- Add quality --q 2 for important outputs
```

### Stable Diffusion
```
✅ Best for: Maximum control, technical precision, custom models
✅ Strengths: ControlNet, LoRAs, inpainting, complete customization
❌ Limitations: Steeper learning curve, requires GPU, setup complexity

Optimization:
- Use DPM++ 2M Karras sampler for quality
- Set steps 40-50 for finals
- CFG Scale 7-9 for balanced results
- Leverage ControlNet for pose/composition control
- Use negative prompts extensively
```

### Gemini 2.0 Flash
```
✅ Best for: Speed, iterative editing, conversational workflow
✅ Strengths: 10-30s generation, text accuracy, free access
❌ Limitations: Less style control than MJ, newer platform

Optimization:
- Use conversational commands for edits
- Upload references for style/face consistency
- Leverage speed for rapid iteration
- Request specific technical details explicitly
```

### Flux
```
✅ Best for: Quality-speed balance, realistic images
✅ Strengths: Fast generation, good prompt following
❌ Limitations: Fewer parameters than SD, less artistic than MJ

Optimization:
- Use Flux.1-dev for quality, Schnell for speed
- Set guidance 3.5-7 for balanced creativity
- 20-30 steps sufficient for most uses
- Works well with detailed technical prompts
```

## 6. PROMPT TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: Subject Not Matching Description

**Problem:** Generated image shows wrong person/object  
**Solution:**
- Front-load subject in first 5 words of prompt
- Use more specific descriptors ("30-year-old woman with shoulder-length red hair" not just "woman")
- Add reference image if available
- Increase CFG scale (SD) or use --iw 2 (MJ)

### Issue: Wrong Style/Aesthetic

**Problem:** Image doesn't match intended artistic style  
**Solution:**
- Use exact style terminology (check platform's style guide)
- Add multiple style reinforcement terms
- Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted styles
- Reference specific artists/movements within ethical bounds
- Midjourney: Adjust --stylize parameter

### Issue: Poor Composition/Framing

**Problem:** Subject cut off, wrong angle, poor framing  
**Solution:**
- Explicitly state composition ("centered", "rule of thirds", "full body visible")
- Specify camera angle ("eye level", "low angle", "bird's eye")
- Mention what should NOT be cropped
- Use ControlNet (SD) for precise composition control
- Add aspect ratio that suits subject (portrait vs landscape)

### Issue: Lighting Too Flat/Wrong

**Problem:** Lighting doesn't create desired mood  
**Solution:**
- Specify light direction ("from left", "backlit", "overhead")
- Use photography terms ("Rembrandt lighting", "golden hour", "high key")
- Mention shadow quality ("soft shadows", "dramatic contrast")
- Add environment context (outdoor/studio/natural)

### Issue: Text Rendering Errors

**Problem:** Text in image is garbled, misspelled, or nonsensical  
**Solution:**
- Use platforms good at text: Imagen 3/4 (95% accuracy), DALL-E 3 (85%)
- Keep text short (5 words or less)
- Specify exact spelling in quotes: "The word 'OPEN' in capital letters"
- Use simple fonts ("bold sans-serif", "clean modern font")
- Avoid cursive/decorative fonts unless platform supports well

### Issue: Inconsistent Results Across Generations

**Problem:** Can't reproduce similar results  
**Solution:**
- Save seed numbers (MJ, SD, Flux)
- Document exact prompt and parameters
- Lock in successful settings before variations
- Use same model version (MJ v6, SD 3.5, etc.)
- Consider using img2img for consistency

## 7. ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Multi-Image Fusion

**Gemini 2.0 Flash, Midjourney**

```
Upload multiple images, then prompt:
"Combine elements from these images: [Image 1's ELEMENT] with [Image 2's STYLE] 
and [Image 3's COMPOSITION]. Blend seamlessly with [MOOD/AESTHETIC]."
```

### Technique 2: Style Transfer with Preservation

```
"Apply the artistic style of Image 1 to Image 2, while preserving Image 2's 
exact subject, pose, facial features, and composition. Match color palette 
from Image 1 but keep Image 2's content intact."
```

### Technique 3: Iterative Refinement Chain

```
Generation 1: Broad concept, simple prompt
↓ Evaluate
Generation 2: Refine subject details
↓ Evaluate
Generation 3: Adjust lighting/mood
↓ Evaluate
Generation 4: Fine-tune composition
↓ Final
```

### Technique 4: Negative Space Emphasis

```
"[SUBJECT] positioned in [LOCATION] of frame. [PERCENTAGE]% negative space in 
[AREA] filled with [COLOR/PATTERN]. Minimalist composition emphasizing emptiness."
```

Example: "Woman in lower left third. 70% negative space in upper right filled with 
soft gradient sky. Minimalist composition emphasizing solitude."
